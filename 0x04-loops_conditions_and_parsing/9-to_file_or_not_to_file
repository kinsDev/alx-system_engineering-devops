# This script provides information about the 'school' file.
# It uses if and else constructs (case statements are not used).
# The script checks whether the 'school' file exists and prints:
# - "school file exists" if the file exists
# - "school file does not exist" if the file does not exist
# If the file exists, it further checks and prints:
# - "school file is not empty" if the file is not empty
# - "school file is empty" if the file is empty
# - "school is a regular file" if the file is a regular file
# (No output is given for other cases).
